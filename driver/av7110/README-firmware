Hi all,

we provide 2 firmware versions. The one that is getting built by default 
provides a Link Layer interface to the CI slots of your DVB card. A sample
implementation of a CI library using this API interface can be found
as part of VDR available at http://www.cadsoft.de/people/kls/vdr or Enigma
available at http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/tuxbox/apps/tuxbox/.

If you want to keep the old behaviour of a full CI implementation in the 
firmware but no CI interface to userspace you have to do this:

$ cp Dpram-icam Dpram
$ cp Root-icam Root
$ cd ..
$ make clean && make

Note, though, that with the '-icam' firmware you also need
to load the driver with 'hw_sections=1' to allow the firmware
to parse the section data necessary for controlling the CAM.
By default the driver is loaded with 'hw_sections=0'.

good luck,

Holger
