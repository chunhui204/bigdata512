This is the first attempt at wrapping the em8300 driver (hoolywood
plus/drx3) with the DVB API. Right now it doesn't work very well and
may cause your system to CRASH. You also need to get the microcode
from your windows drivers (see http://dxr3.sourceforge.net/ on how to
do this) and put it into the microcode directory. Also edit the
Makefile so that the correct microcode is loaded (right now it will
load microcode/microcode0.bin). You also need to set the correct
module parameters for adv717x.o and  em8300.o. See the instructions on
 http://dxr3.sourceforge.net/ on how to do that.
The entire project is still in a very early stage. Since I don't have
much time for it, I release this code so that interested people may
work on it. Note that all the files in the modules directory are the
unchanged original driver files from the sourceforge project, although
they are not the latest version.
Don't forget that you also need the file em8300.h in
DVB/include/linux/.
