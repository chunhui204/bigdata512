This driver needs a copy of the DLL "ttlcdacc.dll" from the
Haupauge or Technotrend windows driver saved as
'/etc/dvb/tda1004x.mc'.

You can also pass the complete file name with the module parameter
'tda1004x_firmware'.

Currently the DLL from v2.15a of the technotrend driver is
supported. Other versions can be added reasonably painlessly.
