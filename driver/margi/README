This is the driver for the Margi/Billionton MPEG decoder PC-Card.
It is still in a beta state and may cause problems with your system.

INSTALLING 
----------
1) You will need a 2.4.x kernel to make everything work
   For ZV support you need 2.4.9-pre2-ac3 or later.

2) go into the DVB/driver directory and type
   makepatch <kernelversion>
   e.g. makepatch 2.4.19-pre2-ac3
	
3) Don't forget to use makedev.napi

4) make menuconfig in kernel dir and setup DVB in Multimedia devices.
   Don't use the video4linux Margi driver, but include v4l support.

5) You can also set the following in .config:
   CONFIG_VIDEO_DEV=m
   CONFIG_DVB=m
   CONFIG_DVB_DEV=m
   CONFIG_MARGI_DVB=m


Using the driver with Linux DVB API 
-----------------------------------

Compile the tuxzap package. Then you can use ntuxplayer 
for playback. Read the documentation in apps/tuxzap


ZV-support
----------

The latest ac-patches have ZV support for various pcmcia controllers.
There are patches for some graphics chips or sound chips in the
zv-diffs directory, like the patches for the Neomagic graphics chip
and YMF sound chip submitted by Shigehiro Nomura. 

There are now three module parameters that are all set to 1 (=on) but can
be set to off in /etc/pcmcia/config.opts
They are : "svhs" for switching the svhs output DAC on or off (0 or 1).
           "composite" for switching the composite output DAC on or off.
           "use_zv" for enabling zv output if you compiled with the
           -DUSE_ZV setting in margi_cs.mk.

E.g. 
module "margi_cs" opts "use_zv=0" 
turns off zv output.
or 
module "margi_cs" opts "composite=0 svhs=0"
turns off the external outputs.
