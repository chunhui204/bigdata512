Configuration:

- You must have the kernel sources for the kernel you are actually using
  installed, and symlinked to /lib/modules/$(KERNEL_VERSION)/build.
  Otherwise, change the path for KERNEL_LOCATION in DVB/driver/Makefile.

- Make sure that your kernel has enabled: 

    Video4Linux Support (CONFIG_VIDEO_DEV)
      needed by cards with integrated MPEG decoder to display video on screen
 
    Input Core Support (CONFIG_INPUT)
    Event Device Support (CONFIG_INPUT_EVDEV)
      needed by the DVB remote control driver

- Login as root, change to the directory DVB and type "make".
  This will build the drivers and all utility and test programs.

- If everything compiled without errors, cd to DVB/drivers and
  type "make insmod" to load the modules. Depending on your hardware
  you may append a "CARDS=av7110" or "CARDS=b2c2" to the "make insmod"
  command line to avoid loading unnecessary drivers (optional).
  During the installation of the modules your PC can "hang" for a
  few seconds. This happens during the loading of the ARM application
  ("firmware") into the DRAM of the AV7110 and is "normal".

  If the drivers work you can install them permanently using "make install".
  See drivers/modules.conf for some hints how to enable autoloading.

- If you don't use devfs, execute DVB/driver/makedev.napi to create
  the device nodes; if you use devfsd, copy drivers/devfsd.conf to
  /etc/devfs/conf.d/dvb (exeact location might depend on you distribution).

- apps/szap/ contains three simple applications for zapping with
  DVB-S, DVB-C or DVB-T cards (szap/czap/tzap); read the comments in
  apps/szap/szap.c for instructions.
  Note 1: tuning succeeded if you see the FE_HAS_LOCK flag and "status 1f";
  	  a good signal has a low bit error rate (ber) and zero
	  uncorrectable packets (unc).
  Note 2: you must keep ?zap running, or the frontend will go to sleep
          (unless you load dvb-core.o with dvb_shutdown_timeout=0)

- If your card has a hardware MPEG decoder you can watch TV
  with xawtv (together with e.g. szap for DVB tuning);
  Note: xawtv cannot control the DVB tuner, you must use ?zap

- For cards without hardware MPEG decoder you need a software
  MPEG decoder, e.g. mplayer or xine (you need *very* recent versions
  which understand MPEG2 transport streams; xine v0.9.21 and
  mplayer dev-CVS-030723-16:39-3.3.1 seem to work);
  Note: You must run ?zap with the -r flag to enable stream output to
        the dvr device, and keep it running while watching tv.
  Examples:
    mplayer - < /dev/dvb/adapter0/dvr0
    xine stdin://mpeg2 < /dev/dvb/adapter0/dvr0
