Hi,

this is a little channel scan utility to generate tzap/czap compatible 
channel lists. Just type make to build the tool and then call it like this:

    # mkdir ~/.czap/
    # ./scan | sort > ~/.czap/channels.conf

for DVB-C or

    # mkdir ~/.tzap/
    # ./scan | sort > ~/.tzap/channels.conf

for DVB-T.

By default, scan checks a the default initial frequencies listed in initial.h.
If no valid initial transponder for your DVB network exists, please add one to
initial.h and post a patch on the LinuxDVB mailing list.

If you want it to check a specific frequency, tune to that frequency 
(e.g. using szap/tzap/czap for DVB-C networks) and then use 'scan -c'

Good luck,

Holger
