Changes for linuxtv-dvb-1.0.0:
o added backport of Technisat Skystar2 (B2C2 FlexCopII) driver from dvb-kernel
o new frontends: tda1004x, mt312
o various frontend fixes for grundig_29504-401, grundig_29504-491, ves1820, alps_tdlb7,
  stv0299
o subtle changes to core frontend code to improve tuning
o dvb_net stability fixes
o AV7110 driver fixes: OSD memory handling; v4l overlay window fixes for Zapping
  (http://zapping.sourceforge.net/); SW section filter fix (stale data);
  MAC handling for dvb_net; link-level CI fixes (for VDR); fix DMX_GET_STC to
  get the msb right; I2C bus speedup; fix grabbing in VIDEO_PALETTE_UYVY mode;
  added module parameter 'latency' to change PCI latency; added IR remote
  control keymaps for Medion MD 4688 (medion_088.rc5 is for address 0,
  medion_155.rc5 for address 2)
o many fixes and extenstions to apps/scan, including correct output in VDR format
o revise "make install" for drivers using DVB_MOD_SUBDIR / DVB_MOD_DIR / DESTDIR


Changes for linuxtv-dvb-1.0.0-pre3:
o scan: considerable rewrite of section I/O using poll() instead of busy waiting
o scan: reports PCR PID and service type (01: TV, 02: radio, >=03: other)
  in "pids" output format
o ves1820 patch by <jaakko@hyvatti.iki.fi> to distinguish different 
  PLL/Synthesizer combinations used by Siemens and Technotrend on their 
  DVB-C cards
o scan: attempt to parse the freqeuency-list descriptor for DVB-T (untested),
  set INVERSION_AUTO for tuning (was 0 == INVERSION_OFF before),
  patch from Franck Arnaud (with modifications) to restore scan output
  to be usable by szap
o av7110: Sharing SDRAM between TT re-insertion and OSD to have more 
  video buffer; firmware version 0x2615
o dvb-core: fixed a deadlock in dvb_frontend.c
o av7110_loadkeys: keymap for universal remote controls by PHILIPS, BAUR, 
  INTERFUNK, MARANTZ, NECKERMANN, OTTO VERSAND, QUELLE, THORN, LIESENKOTTER, 
  contributed by Poul Py
o API change: added VIDEO_EVENT_SIZE_CHANGED and VIDEO_GET_SIZE ioctl
  (both implemented for AV7110 based PCI cards)
o API change: added SEC_VOLTAGE_OFF to turn off satellite frontend power
  (implemented for alps_bsrv2 and stv0299 frontend drivers)
o various improvements to frontend drivers and frontend-thread handling
  (ves1820, grundig_29504-401, alps_tdlb7, stv0299)
o disabled frontend zig-zap scan for DVB-C (improved tuning behaviour)
o fixes and extensions for the "scan" program, including VDR output format
o fixed A/V sync bug with link-layer-CI firmware (always set PCR PID)
o fixes for IR remote control handling (key repeat, device addressing)
o added DMX_GET_STC ioctl
o added software section filter capability to av7110 driver
  (module parameter "hw_sections")
o correct ADAC volume settings (av7110 driver)
o msp3400 volume control fixes for Siemens DVB-C cards
o ...and some things we don't remember. Check the CVS changelogs for
  details, cvsps is your friend... 


Changes for linuxtv-dvb-1.0.0-pre2:
o AV7110 firmware update; fixes OSD problems with VDR
o fixes to poll() handling for audio and video device
o stop video DMA (overlay) when v4l device is closed
o fixes to ring buffer handling for CI link layer interface
o added PCI ids for "Technotrend/Hauppauge Nexus PCI DVB-S"


Changes for linuxtv-dvb-1.0.0-pre1 from siemens_dvb-0.9.4:
o overhauled Linux DVB API, especially for the frontends
o new device naming scheme
o unfortunately too many to list them all...
