Some of the bugs mentioned here might be fixed in the
development driver in the CVS module dvb-kernel.
http://linuxtv.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/

dvb-kernel is targeted for inclusion in the 2.6 kernel,
but a backport for 2.4 is included. You can safely
compile and try the dvb-kernel driver without affecting
your installed DVB driver.

If you have plans to make major modifications you should
do them to dvb-kernel, *not* to the "stable" DVB driver.


o The saa7146 driver included in this version of the DVB driver
  for AV7110 based cards is an old version which supports v4l1
  only. The development driver in CVS module "dvb-kernel" contains
  a new saa7146 driver which supports v4l2.

o The saa7146 has native UYVY byteorder and a hardware bug, which
  prevents it from delivering YUYV at all. This makes it different
  to the bttv chip family, and unfortunately many v4l applications
  assume UYVY and would fail with the saa7146. The saa7146 driver
  therefore performs byte swapping in software. If you have problems
  with capturing performance, that's why.
